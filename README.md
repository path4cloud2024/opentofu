# OpenTofu Infrastructure as Code Repository

## Overview
This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates built using **OpenTofu** (a community-driven, open-source fork of Terraform).  
OpenTofu enables teams to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

---

## What is OpenTofu?
OpenTofu is an infrastructure provisioning tool that allows you to:
- Automate cloud resource creation and management
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Ensure consistency and repeatability across environments
- Work across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)

It is fully open-source and designed to remain **open, stable, and community-driven**, unlike Terraform's recent licensing changes.
