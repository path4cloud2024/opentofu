## We can define the variabes in below files to make the code dynamic.
--> use 03_main_variable.tf file where filename and content are defined as vaiables.

--> values for these variabes are defined in below file:
1) variabes.tf
2) path4cloud.tfvars
3) bin.auto.tfvars
4) or we can defined as Environment variabes like:
    # TF_VAR_<variabes_name> and we can export this before we run tofu apply command.

########
vaiables Precdence:
    - If you have defined a value to variable in many ways, then which value will be
    considered finally.
    - Let say, we have defined a variable value as environment variable, in terraform.tfvars, in
    variable.auto.tfvars and specified with apply command as well with –var flag.
    - Then as per above case, first it will pick the environment variable then terraform.tfvars
    and then *auto.tfcars but in alphatical order if defined many, and finally command line
    flag, -var or –var-file. 

Order for Variables definition precedence:
1) Environment Variables
	TF_VAR_<variable_name>="value"
2) path4cloud.tfvars
3) *.auto.tfvars (*.auto.json)
4) -var or -var-file
